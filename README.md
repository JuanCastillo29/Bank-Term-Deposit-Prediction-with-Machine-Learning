# Bank-Term-Deposit-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Predicting customer subscription to bank term deposits using machine learning
- Achieved Top 30% ranking in Kaggle competition
- 92% ROC-AUC accuracy

## Overview
This project addresses a critical challenge in banking: predicting which customers are most likely to subscribe to term deposits. By leveraging machine learning, banks can optimize their marketing campaigns, reduce costs and improve conversion rates.
The solution combines advanced categorical encoding techniques with XGBoost and LGBoost modeling to achieve superior predictive performance in a competitive Kaggle environment.

## Business Problem
Banks typically experience low conversion rates (10-15%) in term deposit marketing campaigns, resulting in:
- Resource waste on unlikely prospects
- High marketing costs with poor ROI
- Missed revenue opportunities from untargeted approaches

**My Solution**: A machine learning model that identifies high-potential customers for targeted marketing campaigns.

**Source**: Synthetic dataset created with a deep-trained model based on Portuguese banking institution direct marketing campaigns. The data can be found in [This Kaggle competition](www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e8/overview/citation): 
Size: 75,000 customer records
Features: 20 variables including:
- Demographics: Age, job, marital status, education
- Financial: Account balance, housing loan, personal loan
- Campaign: Contact type, month, duration, previous outcomes

Target: Binary classification (subscribed/not subscribed)
